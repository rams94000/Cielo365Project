Project Description:

Developed a biometric-based authentication system integrating fingerprint and face recognition for secure entry.
Implemented role-based access management for Admins, Employees, and Visitors.
Built a centralized reporting module to track attendance and access logs.
Performed manual and automation testing for core modules including:
Biometric authentication
User registration
Access logs
Designed and executed test cases to validate security, performance, and functionality.
Automated regression test cases using Selenium with Java and TestNG to ensure reliability and stability.

Technologies Used:
Devices: Omni-20, Omni-30, ProFace X, Controller and Readers (for biometric access control)
Languages: Java
Automation Tool: Selenium WebDriver
Frameworks: BDD (Behavior Driven Development)
Test Management: TestNG
IDEs: Eclipse (primary), IntelliJ IDEA (used in real-time environments)
